Rewrite the original filename
- if it has a number in it, then keep it but try to keep to two digits.
- Then, Add a very short summary, 1-4 words.
- Summary should be delimited by hyphen. 
- The summary should be brief, non-redundant. 
- Remove the word book, slides, etc which may describe the format, rather than content.
- Remove any subject-specific information, like year, date, course name, location, unless it is important to the content.

Format: "[DD-]{Summary}.{original extension}"
